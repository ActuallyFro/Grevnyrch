= Lyrics
SO you’ve come to a place, which accepts every race
From great beasts to the lowliest gnome
Some throw dice, but-the-real spice, are barbs Fights 
that freq’ent-ly litter our home

Thieves to to your right
And the rogues out of sight
Make all your gold take flight
The [K]onk O’Bar Gang
Make our murderers hang
Next to nightly  Kla’Bbbert Street Fights

Kla'Bbbert Street Fights
Like Kla'Bbbert Street foods
More often than not you find the right spot
Which set perfect  moods


Kla'Bbbert Street Fights
Like Kla'Bbbert's vendors Stalls
You step a mis-step you can abs’lutely bet
You'll be trapped in these walls
